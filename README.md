## General Information
This project is divided into two modules: `Fake_news_detection_from_url_preprocessing` and `Fake_news_detection_from_url_modeling`.

### Fake_news_detection_from_url_preprocessing
This module contains the following steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for FakeNewsNet.
2. Checking URL connection to extract articles.
3. Creating a CSV file from 'active' URL addresses.
4. Text preprocessing.
5. Extracting files to the second module for modeling.

### Fake_news_detection_from_url_modeling
This module includes the following steps:
1. Modeling.
2. Tuning results.
3. Visualizations.

The goal of this project is to prepare a deep learning model to predict whether an article is fake or real news.

Suggestions:
1. The code in this project is time-consuming due to URL check code. To save time, it is recommended to use the prepared files available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12F3tfmnvzquZBHipzskBXitFookz5AnO?usp=share_link).
